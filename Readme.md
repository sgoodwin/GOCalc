GOCalc
=============

This is my experiment with lexers, parsers, and interpreters. I chose a fairly simple example to play with: a 4-function calculator.

When this works properly, it should properly handle expressions like 
```(2+3)*2```
and
```5*(2+(1*7))```
and print out the proper result.

This application runs from the command line with a basic prompt. Cool stuff huh?
